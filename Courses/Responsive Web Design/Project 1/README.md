### Note:
This is the **first certification project** of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course, where I built a **survey form**.

For the best experience, **view the website on full screen on a desktop**.  
If you use a phone or a half-window browser, some elements might break. Iâ€™ll learn and implement responsive design techniques in my future projects!
